My first project to re-familiarise myself with basic Data Visualisation and analysis, after completing an unrelated project as a University module last year. I am to pursue more advanced projects in the future, with libraies that I have not yet used. 
This project gave insight on the stability of the UK Economy, using more advanced metrics for nowcasting, with investor strategic recommendation.
